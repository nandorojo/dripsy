# Dripsy

A **dead-simple**, **responsive** design system for Expo / React Native Web. It's inspired by React's [`theme-ui`](https://theme-ui.com/).

**Style once, run anywhere.**

```jsx
<Text
  sx={{
    fontSize: [14, 16, 20], // 14 on mobile, 16 on tablet, 20 on desktop
    color: ['$primary', null, 'accent'], // `primary` on mobile & tablet, `accent` on desktop
  }}
>
  Responsive font size?? 🤯
</Text>
```

## 🦦 Features

- [(New in 1.4.x!)](/fonts) Custom fonts, edited globally
- [(New in v3!)](/v3) Full TypeScript support
- Responsive styles
- Universal (Android, iOS, Web, & more)
- Works with Expo
- Works with Vanilla React Native
- Works with Next.js
- Full theme support
- Custom theme variants
- Insanely simple API (themed, responsive designs in one line!)
- Works with Animated/Reanimated/Moti
- Dark mode / custom color modes
- Memoized styles, even when written inline
- Atomic CSS classes, with `StyleSheet.create` under the hood
- Use with `@expo/vector-icons` ([example](https://github.com/nandorojo/dripsy/issues/112))
- Linear Gradient
- Performant: `sx` prop is memoized under the hood (even if you write it in render)

## 🤔 Why?

**Build once, deploy everywhere,** is a great philosophy made possible by Expo Web/React Native Web. A large impediment is responsive design.

React Native doesn't have media queries for styles, and trying to micmick it with JS turns into `useState` hell with a ton of conditionals (as you'll see [below](#-before--after).)

While React Native has some great component libraries, it lacks a good design system that is responsive and themed.

No longer. The goal of Dripsy is to let you go from idea to universal, themed styles without much effort.

After trying many, many different ways, I'm convinced this approach is the answer. I'm curious to see if you'll think the same.

## 🏆 Before & After

### Before Dripsy 😢

This is what it took to make _one_ responsive style without Dripsy...

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react'
import { View } from 'react-native'

const ResponsiveBox = () => {
  const [screenWidth, setScreenWidth] = useState(Dimensions.get('window').width)

  useEffect(() => {
    const onResize = (event) => {
      setScreenWidth(event.window.width)
    }
    Dimensions.addEventListener('change', onResize)

    return () => Dimensions.removeEventListener('change', onResize)
  }, [])

  let width = '100%'
  if (screenWidth > 700) {
    width = '50%'
  }

  return <View style={{ width }} />
}
```

### With Dripsy 🤩

```jsx
import { View } from 'dripsy'

const ResponsiveBox = () => {
  return <View sx={{ width: ['100%', '50%'] }} />
}
```

In the future, I may also add support for responsive objects (rather than just arrays):

```jsx
import { View } from 'dripsy'

const ResponsiveBox = () => {
  return (
    <View
      sx={{
        width: {
          '@base': 100,
          '@md': 200,
        },
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

But this is not implemented yet.
