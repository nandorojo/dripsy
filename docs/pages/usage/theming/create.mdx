# Create a Custom Theme

You'll likely want to make a custom theme.

Dripsy makes this incredibly easy.

```jsx
makeTheme({
  colors: {
    $text: '#000',
    $background: '#fff',
    $primary: '#07c',
  },
})
```

## Theme Spec

Dripsy closely follows the `theme-ui` theme spec. Please reference the [`theme-ui` docs](https://theme-ui.com/theming).

There are, however, a few differences.

The following pages will outline where `dripsy` diverges slightly from `theme-ui`.

In some cases, this divergence is due to differences in React Native with CSS. In others, I found that there were better APIs.

## TypeScript Autocomplete

Before continuing, it's worth pointing out that Dripsy has amazing TypeScript
autocomplete based on your theme, unlike Theme UI.

You should reference the [TypeScript guide](/typescript/setup) for more.
