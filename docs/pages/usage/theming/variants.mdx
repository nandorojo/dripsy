# Variants

Every Dripsy component has a `variant` prop, just like Theme UI.

The only difference with Theme UI is that Dripsy also supports _multiple variants_ via the `variants` prop.

`variants` lets you pass multiple (ordered) variants in an array.

Variants pull from your theme to let you reuse code across your app.

Let's go through a few examples of variants you could use.

## Text Variants

If we want to style `Text` components, we use `theme.text`:

```tsx
import { makeTheme, Text } from 'dripsy'

const theme = makeTheme({
  text: {
    thick: {
      fontWeight: 'bold'
    }
  }
})

// ...in our component
<Text variant="thick">Thick Text!</Text>
```

By default, `Text` uses the `theme.text.body` variant.

```tsx
import { makeTheme, Text } from 'dripsy'

const theme = makeTheme({
  text: {
    body: {
      fontSize: 16
    }
  }
})

// ...in our component
<Text>Here is our body.</Text>
```

### HTML Variants

Each HTML-inpsired component can also be styled by default from the theme:

```tsx
import { makeTheme, P, H1 } from 'dripsy'

const theme = makeTheme({
  text: {
    p: {
      mt: 0,
      fontSize: 14
    },
    h1: {
      fontSize: 30
    }
  }
})

<P>My font size is 14!</P>

<H1>Mine is 30.</H1>
```

## Container Variants

You can use `theme.layout` to style your containers.

```tsx
import { Container, makeTheme } from 'dripsy'

const theme = makeTheme({
  sizes: {
    container: 900
  }
})

<Container>
  <Text>My max width is 900!</Text>
</Container>
```

By default `Container` uses the `sizes.container` as its max width.

It also uses the `theme.layout.container` variant by default, so you can style it like so:

```tsx
import { Container, makeTheme } from 'dripsy'

const theme = makeTheme({
  sizes: {
    container: 900
  },
  layout: {
    container: {
      px: 8
    }
  }
})

<Container>
  <Text>My max width is 900, and I have 8px horizontal padding.</Text>
</Container>
```

And finally, you could create a custom `Container` variant altogether:

```tsx
import { Container, makeTheme } from 'dripsy'

const theme = makeTheme({
  layout: {
    wide: {
      maxWidth: 1100
    }
  }
})

<Container variant="wide">
  <Text>My max width is 1100px.</Text>
</Container>
```

## Defining Variants

To define a component's variants, you use the [styled](/apis/styled) function.

For example, this is what the `Container` code looks like under the hood:

```tsx
import { View as NativeView } from 'react-native'
import { styled } from 'dripsy'

export const Container = styled(NativeView, {
  defaultVariant: 'container',
  themeKey: 'layout',
})({
  mx: 'auto',
  maxWidth: 'container',
  width: '100%',
})
```

Notice the `themeKey` and `defaultVariant`. These are both optional, but they let you access the theme for a given component.

## Variants on any component

Technically, you can use any variant on any component, regardless of its `themeKey`.

For instance: `View` does not have a `themeKey` specified.

However, our `layout` variants which we were using on `Container` can still apply to a `View`.

You would just have to define your `variant` prop at the root of the theme:

```tsx
import { View, makeTheme } from 'dripsy'

const theme = makeTheme({
  layout: {
    wide: {
      maxWidth: 1100
    }
  }
})

<View variant="layout.wide">
  <Text>My max width is 1100px.</Text>
</Container>
```

Notice that the `variant` prop here is `layout.wide`, whereas with `Container`, it was simply `wide`.
