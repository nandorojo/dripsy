# Responsive Design

Dripsy provides in-line support for setting responsive values in your styles. You just have to provide an array values in your styles, and dripsy will automatically match the values to the breakpoints:

```jsx
<Text
  sx={{
    fontSize: [14, 16, 20], // 14 on mobile, 16 on tablet, 20 on desktop
    color: ['$primary', null, 'accent'], // `primary` on mobile & tablet, `accent` on desktop
  }}
>
  Responsive font size?? 🤯
</Text>
```

## Default breakpoints

Dripsy provides [Bootstrap's](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/) default breakpoints:

- **576** (landscape phones, 576px and up)
- **768** (tablets, 768px and up)
- **992** (desktops, 992px and up)
- **1200** (large desktops, 1200px and up)

## Overriding default breakpoints

You can also pass in your own breakpoints into [makeTheme](/apis/makeTheme):

```ts
const theme = makeTheme({
  breakpoints: ['576', '768', '992', '1200'],
  // ...
})
```

## Retrieving breakpoint values outside themes

Dripsy provides two hooks for working with breakpoints:

### `useBreakpoints()`

Returns the current array of breakpoints:

```ts
const breakpoints = useBreakpoints()
console.log(breakpoints) // [576, 768, 992, 1200]
```

### `useBreakpointIndex()`

Returns the index of the current breakpoint. For example, if your theme has the default breakpoints, and the screen's width is 1600px, the hook returns `4`.

```ts
const breakpointIndex = useBreakpointIndex()
console.log(breakpointIndex) // 4
```

- width <576 ➡️ 0
- width 576-767 ➡️ 1
- width 768-991 ➡️ 2
- width 992-1119 ➡️ 3
- and width >=1200 ➡️ 4

You can also use this hook to conditionally render components based on screen size. For example, to only render a certain component if the user is viewing the page on a desktop, you can use `{breakpointIndex >= 4 && (...)}`
